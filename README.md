### Hi there, I'm Anders 🤖🙌🏻

I'm a Data Scientist at [Firmnav](https://firmnav.com/) and MSc student in Data Science at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/). 

- 🤟 I teach computers understand language. 
- 🇩🇰 I'm trying to see if I can help building cool NLP tools in Danish.
- 🏥 I'm also particularly interested in combining the two above and apply it in the healthcare sector.
- 👨🏼‍💻 I recently started tracking my ML experiments on [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/hrmussa). Go check it out, it's a nice tool.
- 🔗 You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndersGiovanni) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anders-giovanni-m%C3%B8ller-b02458105/).
